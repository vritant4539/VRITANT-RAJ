    "The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: This principle involves bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit, or object. It also restricts direct access to some of the object’s components, which helps protect the integrity of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Abstraction focuses on hiding the complex reality while exposing only the necessary parts. It allows programmers to work with higher-level concepts without needing to understand all the details of the underlying implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: This concept allows one class (the child or subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (the parent or superclass). Inheritance promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism enables methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon. It allows for the use of a single interface or method to represent different underlying forms (data types), typically achieved through method overriding and overloading.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes and Objects: Classes are blueprints for creating objects, defining the properties and behaviors that the objects will have. An object is an instance of a class, representing a specific implementation of that blueprint with actual data.\n",
    "\n",
    "These concepts work together to provide a robust framework for designing and organizing code in an OOP paradigm."
